Some of my interests  and areas of focus are;

Â¶ Actively seeking new opportunities to expand my skill set. 

Â¶ Data Studio report designs for e commerce businesses looking to automate    their reporting process.

Â¶ Content Writing and Notion.

Â¶ Working with clients worldwide (Homebase: Quebec)

Â¶ Latex: in notion

Â¶ Graphic Design: Mockups and social media designs

Â¶ Notion templates

Â¶ I am Google certified in IT Support Fundamentals (Google Career Certificates)

In the process of mastering one skill, which is selling digital productivity items, it has lead me down the path of learn so many other fun skills.

Selling digital products to my circle, has encouraged me to start my own ecommerce business on platforms such as Fiverr and Upwork, soon to include Amazon and Shopify. See some of my work here https://www.fiverr.com/share/qeb569. Here is an example of content layout https://sirmusik.notion.site/Example-Metal-seam-business-45f8a97038904cba83849ef250c32cca. 

I can also  create marketing materials such as landing pages, email templates, social media content, and more.

As for structured learning, I have embarked on completing  a thorough HTML and data studio course. These skills will help me in my ecommerce journey(Shopify and Amazon).
